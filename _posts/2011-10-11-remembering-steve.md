I remember Steve, not personally, or from the gadgets that he helped to create, which I love and use daily.

I remember Steve as a man who was not afraid to be a leader.

<!--break-->

A man who knew the direction he wanted to go and went there.

A man who inspired others to go to the places he envisioned.

A man who inspired those around him to be greater than what they had been.

A man who inspired people to think beyond the status quo.

A man who continues to inspires us to greatness even in death.

A man who followed his heart.

Steve had a vision and passion for what technology could bring to the average person.

While he created gadgets and gizmos his drive and methods can be applied anywhere and to all aspects of our lives.

In that Steve's spirit will continue to live on.

&nbsp;

I remember Steve.
